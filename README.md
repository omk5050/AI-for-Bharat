## AI for Communities, Access & Public Impact

### Why This Problem Matters

Hackathons are often won not by the most technically complex solution, but by the one that demonstrates **clear real-world value**. Judges prioritize:

* Realistic deployment scenarios
* Awareness of constraints such as language, accessibility, and bandwidth
* A clearly defined beneficiary

This project is intentionally designed with those priorities in mind.

### Problem Understanding

Access to public welfare schemes remains a major challenge. Many eligible citizens fail to benefit due to:

* Lack of awareness
* Complex eligibility criteria
* Bureaucratic language
* Poor personalization in existing portals

Instead of building a large, unrealistic system, this project focuses on solving **one precise problem effectively**.

### Design Philosophy

Most hackathon teams make one of two mistakes:

* Building overly broad solutions (e.g., “AI for villages”)
* Attempting government-scale platforms that are impossible to deliver in a hackathon

This project follows the opposite approach:

✅ Be small
✅ Be precise
✅ Be deployable
✅ Be explainable

### What Judges Expect — And How This Project Aligns

| Judge Expectation             | How This Project Addresses It                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Believable deployment         | Designed for community help centers and low-resource environments |
| Emotional user story          | Focused on citizens who miss benefits due to information barriers |
| Inclusion by design           | Simplifies complex rules into understandable guidance             |
| Real-world friction awareness | Minimal inputs, clear outputs, low technical dependency           |

### Competition Strategy

This track typically has the **lowest competition risk when scoped correctly**.
Rather than chasing technical flashiness, this project emphasizes:

* Practical usefulness
* Strong problem framing
* Clear beneficiary impact

**Winning strategy: Small, focused, and executable.**
